Website URL - https://thecse.github.io/To-Do/

## Things Covered

1. Used TypeScript to provide type-safety.
2. Added basic form validation like preventing addition of empty task.
3. Layout made responsive upto 260px, can we viewed comfortabily in phone of 1/2 to 1/3 width of your mobile device.
4. Used Context API for state management and also used multiple hooks to allow re-rendering of value after getting changed.
5. Used localStorage to persist data.
6. Didn't add undo or redo functionality, can be added easily using stacks, however I've added edit feature and calander to create to-do list for any other days.
7. None of the file has more than ~80 lines which makes the code easy to read and review.
8. Every componenet is separated into different files and can be re-used if required.

## Improvement Areas
1. CSS formatting could have been better, primary goal was to create app with basic feature, will improve the design in further iterations.
2. Some line items could have been wrapped into functions by doing some tweeks, it would have improved readiblity and reduce number of lines of code.
3. Features like Undo, Redo, Backlog tasks, Past days pending alert etc.
